                <p>I enjoy helping people; it's just in my nature...</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I want others to succeed, and I like when they succeed because of something I've done to help. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Naturally this passion for helping people lead me to teaching. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was an elementary school teacher for 10 years. I loved helping students master a new concept. Kids
                        learning to love math, becoming readers, discovering science... all of that was great!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> However I found myself looking for more. I wanted to know what else existed outside of teaching... it
                        was all I knew. It was all I had ever seen myself doing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Then one day my husband suggested coding. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>ME?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> You're a natural. You break down tasks all the time. You can teach a 10 year to divide! Now just teach
                        the computers.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It wasn't something that had entered my world until that moment. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Me? </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Why not me?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So I played around with Codeacademy for a few weeks, and just searched around online to see what was
                        out there.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I found that there was a lot out there.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I found the U of A Coding Bootcamp. I called them. They told me I'd have to pass a test and a screening
                        interview to be accepted into the program.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Me? </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I thought I was doomed. I knew NOTHING about coding. How would I pass?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> But then I went for it. I decided that was exactly what I needed to do. If I could pass the test and the interview
                        then I knew it was the right choice. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> If not? </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I can always try something else. But this was a place to start. A place to try something new. To be creative. To challenge
                        myself. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I went for it and I passed. They said I did great. (Maybe they tell everyone that?!?) </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was shocked, but also not. Of course I passed. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Why NOT me? </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I'm smart. I can learn anything I want. Nothing holding me back....</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I began the boot camp in January. I learned so much. So much, so fast. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So much coding... So many languages, and libraries, and programs, and data bases... and the syntax for all of these... </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And so much more. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am a smart person (I have to remind myself of this often). This boot camp was the biggest challenge
                        I've met. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Every single thing was hard for me. I'm not used to that.  I had ZERO prior experience. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The weird thing was I never wanted to give up. Never. I just wanted to figure things out. I wanted to
                        know why things weren't working.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Or why they were.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I wanted to figure it out. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Don't get me wrong. I have banged my head against the wall so many times. Like every day. Sometimes by the minute...
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But I never wanted to quit. I just wanted to figure things out. I wanted to know why things worked. Or
                        didn't.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I think this makes me a coder. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I could have hated this. I had no experience.... I really had no idea what I was getting myself into. There were many, many times I could
                        have thought "Why did I do this?  What was I thinking..."</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I could have just tried to "survive" the 6 months and then give up. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> However I did survive. And I don't want to give up. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I have so much more to learn. I can't stop now. I know too much. My brain has the beginnings of so much
                        knowledge. I can't stop now.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I want to dig in. Learn more. Fill in the gaps that I may have missed in boot camp.... I want experience.
                        I want to practice. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I want to know more. </p>
