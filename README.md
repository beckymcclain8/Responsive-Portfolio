# Responsive-Portfolio

I was a part of the January-July cohort of the University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp.  This is the portfolio I put together containing all of the projects I worked on throughout the boot camp.  This portfolio was designed in week 2, and is still a work in progress.  I continue to study and learn and look forward to creating more projects independently to add to it.

Please take a look and let me know if you have questions!
