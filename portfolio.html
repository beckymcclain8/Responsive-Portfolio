                <p>JARVIS 2.0 was a rebuild and expansion upon the original JARVIS healthcare app listed below.  With JARVIS 2.0 you can now 
                    save the results of your search and find them on your personal patient page. We used Google OAuth, so you can login simply
                    with your Google account. </p>
                <br>
                <p>JARVIS 2.0 is built with the MERN stack:  MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.  Like the original, it is an app that takes the 
                    guesswork out of finding cost-effective hospital options.</p>

                <p>JARVIS is a healthcare app that takes the guesswork out of finding cost-effective hospital options. We know
                    that the cost of procedures varies based on hospitals, location, etc. With JARVIS you can enter your
                    location, procedure, and the distance you're willing to drive. With that information we will find the
                    hospitals that perform your procedure at the lowest cost, within your search radius. </p>

                <p>JARVIS was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.</p>

                <p>My very first game! It seemed so difficult at the time... This was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
